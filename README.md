# angular-correlation-of-electron-positron-annihilation-radiation
This experiment was conducted to demostrate the momentum conservation in electron-positron annihilation by measuring the simultaneous, antiparallel emission of 511keV gamma-ray photons from a Na-22 source.

## apparatus used:
1. Two NaI scintillation detectors
2. Two Single Channel Analysers (SCA)
3. Multi Channel Analyser (MCA)
4. Coincidence Analyser
5. Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO)
6. Cs-137, Co-60 and Na-22 sources

## results:
The frequency of the coincidence signals from Na-22 was significantly higher (~ 350 to 400 Hz) than that from Cs-137 (~ 20 to 60 Hz). Thus proving that there were two antiparallel gamma rays emitted in the case of Na-22.
Upon changing the angle between the two scintillation detectors, it was observed that the frequency of the coincidence signals decreased as the angle tended to 90 degrees. Thus verifying the conservation of momentum.
